<h1><br>(b)The Die-away Curve</h1>
<p class="a rotatedFloralHeartBullet">


<p>If we were to take $p$ as a proper fraction (less than
unity), the curve would obviously tend to sink downwards,
as in <a href="#figure42">Figure 42</a>, where each successive ordinate
is $\frac{3}{4}$ of the height of the preceding one.


<a name="figure42">
<p><img src="33283-t/images/168a.pdf.png-1.png">

<p>The equation is still
\[
y=bp^x;
\] but since $p$ is less than one, $\log_\epsilon p$ will be a negative
quantity, and may be written $-a$; so that $p=\epsilon^{-a}$,
and now our equation for the curve takes the form
\[
y=b\epsilon^{-ax}.
\]

<p>The importance of this expression is that, in the
case where the independent variable is <em>time</em>, the
equation represents the course of a great many
physical processes in which something is <em>gradually
dying away</em>. Thus, the cooling of a hot body is
represented (in Newton's celebrated “law of cooling”)
by the equation
\[
\theta_t=\theta_0 \epsilon^{-at};
\]

where $\theta_0$ is the original excess of temperature of a
hot body over that of its surroundings, $\theta_t$ the excess
of temperature at the end of time $t$, and $a$ is a constant–namely,
the constant of decrement, depending
on the amount of surface exposed by the body, and
on its coefficients of conductivity and emissivity,
etc.

<p>A similar formula,
\[
Q_t=Q_0 \epsilon^{-at},
\]
is used to express the charge of an electrified body,
originally having a charge $Q_0$, which is leaking away
with a constant of decrement $a$; which constant
depends in this case on the capacity of the body and
on the resistance of the leakage-path.

<p>Oscillations given to a flexible spring die out after
a time; and the dying-out of the amplitude of the
motion may be expressed in a similar way.

<p>In fact $\epsilon^{-at}$ serves as a <em>die-away factor</em> for all
those phenomena in which the rate of decrease
is proportional to the magnitude of that which is
decreasing; or where, in our usual symbols, $\dfrac{dy}{dt}$ is
proportional at every moment to the value that $y$ has
at that moment. For we have only to inspect the
curve, <a href="#figure42">Figure 42</a> above, to see that, at every part of it,
the slope $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ is proportional to the height $y$; the
curve becoming flatter as $y$ grows smaller. In symbols,
thus

$y=b\epsilon^{-ax}$ or
\[
\log_\epsilon y
  = \log_\epsilon b - ax \log_\epsilon \epsilon
  = \log_\epsilon b - ax,\\
 \text{and, differentiating,}\;
\frac{1}{y}\, \frac{dy}{dx} = -a;\\
 \text{hence}\;  \frac{dy}{dx} = b\epsilon^{-ax} × (-a) = -ay;
\]
or, in words, the slope of the curve is downward, and
proportional to $y$ and to the constant $a$.

<p>We should have got the same result if we had
taken the equation in the form
\begin{align*}
y &= bp^x; \\
 \text{for then}\;
\frac{dy}{dx}
  &= bp^x × \log_\epsilon p. \\
   \text{But}\;
\log_\epsilon p &= -a; \\
 \text{giving us}\;
\frac{dy}{dx} &= y × (-a) = -ay,
\end{align*}
as before.

<p><em>The Time-constant.</em> In the expression for the “die-away
factor” $\epsilon^{-at}$, the quantity $a$ is the reciprocal of
another quantity known as “<em>the time-constant</em>,” which
we may denote by the symbol $T$. Then the die-away
factor will be written $\epsilon^{-\frac{t}{T}}$; and it will be seen, by
making $t = T$ that the meaning of $T$ $\left(\text{or of} \dfrac{1}{a}\right)$ is that
this is the length of time which it takes for the original
quantity (called $\theta_0$ or $Q_0$ in the preceding instances)
to die away $\dfrac{1}{\epsilon}$th part–that is to $0.3678$–of its
original value.


<p>The values of $\epsilon^x$ and $\epsilon^{-x}$ are continually required
in different branches of physics, and as they are given
in very few sets of mathematical tables, some of the
values are tabulated here for convenience.

<p>As an example of the use of this table, suppose
there is a hot body cooling, and that at the beginning
of the experiment (<em>i.e.:</em> when $t = 0$) it is $72°$ hotter than
the surrounding objects, and if the time-constant of its
cooling is $20$ minutes (that is, if it takes $20$ minutes
for its excess of temperature to fall to $\dfrac{1}{\epsilon}$ part of $72°$),
then we can calculate to what it will have fallen in
any given time $t$. For instance, let $t$ be $60$ minutes.
Then $\dfrac{t}{T} = 60 ÷ 20 = 3$, and we shall have to find the
value of $\epsilon^{-3}$, and then multiply the original $72°$ by
this. The table shows that $\epsilon^{-3}$ is $0.0498$. So that
at the end of $60$ minutes the excess of temperature
will have fallen to $72° × 0.0498 = 3.586°$.

<p><hr>

<p><em>Further Examples.</em>
<p>(1) The strength of an electric current in a conductor
at a time $t$ secs. after the application of the
electromotive force producing it is given by the expression
$C = \dfrac{E}{R}\left\{1 - \epsilon^{-\frac{Rt}{L}}\right\}$.

<p>The time constant is $\dfrac{L}{R}$.

<p>If $E = 10$, $R =1$, $L = 0.01$; then when $t$ is very large
the term $\epsilon^{-\frac{Rt}{L}}$ becomes $1$, and $C = \dfrac{E}{R} = 10$; also
\[
\frac{L}{R} = T = 0.01.
\]

<p>Its value at any time may be written:
\[
C = 10 - 10\epsilon^{-\frac{t}{0.01}},
\]

the time-constant being $0.01$. This means that it
takes $0.01$ sec. for the variable term to fall by
$\dfrac{1}{\epsilon} = 0.3678$ of its initial value $10\epsilon^{-\frac{0}{0.01}} = 10$.

<p>To find the value of the current when $t = 0.001 \text{sec.}$,
say, $\dfrac{t}{T} = 0.1$, $\epsilon^{-0.1} = 0.9048$ (from table).

<p>It follows that, after $0.001$ sec., the variable term
is $0.9048 × 10 = 9.048$, and the actual current is
$10 - 9.048 = 0.952$.

<p>Similarly, at the end of $0.1$ sec.,
\[
\frac{t}{T} = 10;\quad \epsilon^{-10} = 0.000045;
\]
the variable term is $10 × 0.000045 = 0.00045$, the current
being $9.9995$.

<p>(2) The intensity $I$ of a beam of light which has
passed through a thickness $l$ cm. of some transparent
medium is $I = I_0\epsilon^{-Kl}$, where $I_0$ is the initial intensity
of the beam and $K$ is a “constant of absorption.”

<p>This constant is usually found by experiments. If
it be found, for instance, that a beam of light has
its intensity diminished by 18% in passing through
$10$ cms. of a certain transparent medium, this means
that $82 = 100 × \epsilon^{-K×10}$ or $\epsilon^{-10K} = 0.82$, and from the
table one sees that $10K = 0.20$ very nearly; hence
$K = 0.02$.

<p>To find the thickness that will reduce the intensity
to half its value, one must find the value of $l$ which
satisfies the equality $50 = 100 × \epsilon^{-0.02l}$, or $0.5 = \epsilon^{-0.02l}$.

It is found by putting this equation in its logarithmic
form, namely,
\[
\log 0.5 = -0.02 × l × \log \epsilon,
\]
which gives
\[

l = \frac{-0.3010}{-0.02 × 0.4343}
 = 34.7 \text{centimetres nearly}.
\]

<p>(3) The quantity $Q$ of a radio-active substance
which has not yet undergone transformation is known
to be related to the initial quantity $Q_0$ of the substance
by the relation $Q = Q_0 \epsilon^{-\lambda t}$, where $\lambda$ is a constant
and $t$ the time in seconds elapsed since the transformation
began.

<p>For “Radium $A$,” if time is expressed in seconds,
experiment shows that $\lambda = 3.85 × 10^{-3}$. Find the time
required for transforming half the substance. (This
time is called the “mean life” of the substance.)

<p>We have $0.5 = \epsilon^{-0.00385t}$.<a name="erratum0a"/>
\begin{align*}
\log 0.5 &= -0.00385t × \log \epsilon; \\
 \text{and}\;
t &= 3\text{ minutes very nearly}.
\end{align*}
